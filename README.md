# marugoto_mods
My modifications to marugoto by Kather Lab (https://github.com/KatherLab/marugoto.git)

Also includes a version of highres-WSI-heatmaps (https://github.com/KatherLab/highres-WSI-heatmaps.git) that uses canny edge detection to remove artefacts.

Please reference their work if using this repo!

NOTE: this is a work in progress - additional functionality may be added as I discover things I need!
